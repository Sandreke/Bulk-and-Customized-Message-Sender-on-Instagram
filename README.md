# Bulk-and-Customized-Message-Sender-on-Instagram

📸 Send bulk and personalized messages on #Instagram using Selenium in Python

You can send them to any user! (even to accounts that don't follow you)

🏭 This project carried out with #Python aims to help #ventures and #businesses to optimize communication with customers by reducing costs and man-hours, as well as generating quality interactions with them due to the #personalization of messages.

📱 I take as a use case to carry out a #marketing campaign -for the new products of an online cell phone store on Instagram- based on the sales of 6 months ago in search of the #repurchase and #loyalty of these customers.

🚀 Definitely, it can be extrapolated to different cases such as sending exclusive content, welcome messages to new followers, moving from awareness to interest in the #funnel, among others.
